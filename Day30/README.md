## Creational Design Patterns
- Creational patterns deal with object creation, improving flexibility, and reuse of code. 
- They allow the creation process to be decoupled from the actual class implementations.

### **1. Factory Design Pattern**

- **Why Use:**
  - To create objects without specifying their concrete class.
  - Simplifies object creation logic and centralizes it in a factory.
  - Helps when the type of object required is determined at runtime.

- **Benefits:**
  - Promotes loose coupling between client code and the object creation logic.
  - Makes code more maintainable and scalable.
  - Reduces duplication by reusing object creation logic.

- **What We Can Achieve:**
  - Flexibility in creating different types of objects.
  - Centralized control over object creation.

### **2. Abstract Factory Pattern**

- **Why Use:**
  - To create families of related objects that need to work together.
  - Useful when multiple object types need to be instantiated depending on a systemâ€™s context.

- **Benefits:**
  - Ensures consistency among objects of a family.
  - Encapsulates object creation logic for multiple related types.

- **What We Can Achieve:**
  - Creation of grouped objects that can be interchanged or extended without changing the client code.
  - Cleaner separation of concerns for object families.

### **Difference from Factory Pattern**
- Factory Pattern focuses on creating a single type of object based on input.
- Abstract Factory Pattern deals with creating families of related objects, ensuring compatibility and consistency between them.

### **3. Singleton Design Pattern**

- **Why Use:**
  - To ensure that only one instance of a class is created.
  - Used when a single instance needs to coordinate actions across the system (e.g., configuration, logging, caching).

- **Benefits:**
  - Saves memory by avoiding multiple object instances.
  - Provides a single point of access for shared resources.

- **What We Can Achieve:**
  - Global access to a single instance.
  - Controlled resource access and better system coordination.

### **4. Prototype Design Pattern**

- **Why Use:**
  - To create duplicate objects efficiently without modifying the original structure.
  - Useful for creating copies of objects that are costly to create from scratch.

- **Benefits:**
  - Improves performance by reusing existing objects.
  - Reduces the need to create new instances repeatedly.

- **What We Can Achieve:**
  - Object cloning for scenarios like caching or large object instantiation.
  - Decoupled and flexible object creation.

### **5. Builder Design Pattern**

- **Why Use:**
  - To construct complex objects step-by-step.
  - Allows customization of the final object while hiding its internal structure.

- **Benefits:**
  - Simplifies the construction of complex objects with many optional fields.
  - Enhances code readability and maintainability.

- **What We Can Achieve:**
  - Construction of objects in a clear, modular, and reusable manner.
  - Easy addition or modification of object creation steps.
